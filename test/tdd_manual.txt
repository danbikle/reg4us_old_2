tdd_manual.txt

This file should list a set of manual tests which should help me develop my app.

My app should be called reg4.us

reg4.us should predict up or down action of SP500 daily closing prices.

I should be able to operate my reg4.us manually.

I should be able to operate my reg4.us automatically using cron.

I should develop reg4.us on Ubuntu 16.04 running in a virtualbox appliance.

I should deploy reg4.us to Heroku as a Rails app.

reg4.us should be visible from this URL: reg4.herokuapp.com
